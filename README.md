# Human Tracking, Face Detection and Recognition
## Overview
Nowadays, many closedcircuit television cameras are applied in the public places such as bank, hotel, and etc. for the safety purposes. Though people do not have to monitor the area with the help of surveillance cameras, they still have to spend time trying to identify someone in the video. And sometimes this could cost a huge amount of time to search by people and results are not good. If a computer could identify a person by itself, it will save lots of human efforts.

In this project, a program is developed which can detect a person and his/her face in a given video and then recognize him/her by using features in the pre-trained model of that person. If the person is detected in the video for the first time, a label number will be assigned to that person. And that person can be tracked and recognized in any other given videos.
